I am Shakir Showkat Sofi, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at KU Leuven, Belgium, working with Prof. Lieven De Lathauwer. My research lies at the intersection of computational mathematics, signal processing, and data mining, with a focus on tensor decompositions for data compression, data completion, and their applications in quantum state tomography and spatiotemporal pattern mining.

Previously, I earned an M.Sc. in Data Science from the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech), Russia, where I completed my thesis under the supervision of Prof. Ivan Oseledets. I also hold a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from the Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST), India.

My research is driven by the goal of developing scalable, interpretable, and theoretically grounded machine learning models. I am particularly interested in low-rank modeling, tensor-based representation learning, and efficient algorithms for high-dimensional, structured data.
