I am Shakir Showkat Sofi, a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT)](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/), Belgium, working with [Prof. Lieven De Lathauwer](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/stadiusincludes/person.php?id=22). My research lies at the intersection of computational mathematics, signal processing, and data mining. Specifically, my focus is on tensor decompositions for data compression, data completion, and their applications in quantum state tomography and spatiotemporal pattern mining.

Previously, I earned an M.Sc. in Data Science from the [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech)](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/) in Russia, where I completed my thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Ivan Oseledets](https://oseledets.github.io/). 

My research interests are: <br>
- Tensor methods for AI/ML.
- Multidimensional data completion and compression.
- Spatiotemporal pattern mining with applications in traffic flow and climate/weather forecasting.
- Quantum state tomography.
