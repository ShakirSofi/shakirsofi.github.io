I am a Ph.D. candidate in Engineering Scienceq at KU Leuven, Belgium, specializing in computational mathematics, signal processing, and data mining. My research focuses on tensor decompositions, matrix and tensor completion, spatiotemporal forecasting, and geospatial applications, such as weather and traffic prediction.

Previously, I earned an M.Sc. in Data Science from Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech), Russia, and a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from the Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST), India.

My work blends theory and practice, and I have a strong interest in data compression, low-rank modeling, and interpretable machine learning. I actively use Python and MATLAB in my research and enjoy building tools and algorithms for large-scale data analysis.
