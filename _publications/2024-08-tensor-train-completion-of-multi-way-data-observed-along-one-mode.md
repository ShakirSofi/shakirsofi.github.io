excerpt: "This paper introduces a non-optimization-based method to complete an incomplete tensor under a fiber-wise observation pattern—i.e., only whole mode-N fibers are observed—by computing a Tensor-Train decomposition using standard linear algebra (e.g., SVD/QR) on partially observed unfoldings."
