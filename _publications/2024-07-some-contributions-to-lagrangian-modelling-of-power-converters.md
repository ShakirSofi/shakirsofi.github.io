excerpt: "This work extends Euler–Lagrange (energy-based) modelling to high-fidelity power converters by refining the modelling procedure, introducing a principled way to incorporate circuit constraints via variable labeling, and deriving accurate switched state-space models that account for non-idealities—demonstrated through examples like diode rectifiers and DC–DC boost converters."
