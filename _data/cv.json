It covers foundational models like CP and Tucker decompositions, explores advanced techniques such as tensor networks and Tensor Train, and discusses their applications in areas like source separation, feature extraction, and multi-view learning. The paper also addresses computational challenges and introduces strategies for scalable tensor recovery, offering insights into the future directions of tensor-based methodologies."

      "summary": "This paper introduces a non‑optimization-based method to complete an incomplete tensor under a fiber‑wise observation pattern—i.e., only whole mode‑N fibers are observed—by computing a Tensor‑Train decomposition using standard linear algebra (e.g., SVD/QR) on partially observed unfoldings. It provides deterministic uniqueness guarantees under structured sampling and demonstrates fast, accurate recovery in synthetic noisy high‑order tensors (e.g., 5th‑order) compared to TT‑WOPT and SiLRTC‑TT."
